                        <p>In contrast to traditional/mainstream social media services, the InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) (developers, contractors or founders of InkDrop) (“we”, “our”, “us”) cares deeply about your privacy and is committed to protecting and respecting it. Please read this policy carefully, as it sets out the basis on how we will collect, use and process your personal data or usage information as well as your related rights and obligations. </p>

                        <p>This policy describes the data or information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with your use of our InkDrop branded application accessible through <a href="https://app.inkdrop.tech" target="_blank">https://app.inkdrop.tech</a> (<strong>“Network”</strong>) and our website or newsletter at <a href="https://inkdrop.tech" target="_blank">https://inkdrop.tech</a> (<strong>“Website”</strong>). For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), we are the data controller with regards to the Website.</p>

                        <p>By accessing the InkDrop Website or using the InkDrop Network, you confirm to have carefully reviewed and to fully understand and agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this document in general or any part of it, you should not access the InkDrop Website or use the InkDrop Network.</p>

                        <p>The <strong>InkDrop Social Network</strong> is part of the Web 3 movement.

While the InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) has developed and will continue to develop InkDrop, it does not operate or control it and/or the content made available by its users. The InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) merely operates the web-interface (https://app.inkdrop.tech) used to access InkDrop.</p>

                        <p>Because the current version of the InkDrop Network is a Private-Beta release only, we may ask you to review and accept new or supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with InkDrop and newly introduced functionalities in the future.</p>

                        <h5 class="pt-3">1. Information We Collect</h5>

                        <h5 class="pt-3 ">5. Rights & Obligations Concerning Personal Data</h5>
                        <p><strong>InkDrop Network </strong><br/> 5.1 You may not fully delete any data published through InkDrop on the underlying IPFS storage layer. When you remove data, it is only delisted on the InkDrop Network which makes it more difficult to be found for others. However, removed data persist without any time limitation and may still be available to others. It is envisaged that updated versions of the InkDrop Network will offer the functionality to self-remove personal data. For the beta version, however, we require you to send an according request to <a href="mailto:hello@inkdrop.tech">hello@inkdrop.tech</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>5.2 We require you to take appropriate steps to keep confidential any data that you do not want shared. Do not disclose personal data on InkDrop. If you receive personal data from others on InkDrop, use it appropriately and keep it confidential – assume that such data is being disclosed only for your personal use and not to be shared with others.
                        </p>

                        <p>5.3 Please note that when creating an Identity on InkDrop, you will connect your personal data to an Ethereum Address (i.e. public key). The Ether (ETH) balance of that public key will be displayed on your profile. Therefore, we recommend you set up a new address.</p>

                        <p><strong>InkDrop Website </strong><br/> 5.4 We set out below an outline of those rights and how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. To exercise any of your rights, please email to <a href="mailto:hello@inkdrop.tech">hello@inkdrop.tech</a>. Please note that for each of the rights below we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your request, in such instances we will let you know if that is the case.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Access: You have the right to know whether we process personal data about you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with.</li>
                            <li>Correction: You have the right to require us to correct any personal data held about you that is inaccurate and have incomplete data completed.</li>
                            <li>Erasure: You may request that we erase the personal data we hold about you in the following circumstances: where you believe it is no longer necessary for us to hold the personal data, we are processing it on the basis of your consent and you wish to withdraw your consent, we are processing your data on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing, you no longer wish us to use your data to send you marketing or you believe we are unlawfully processing your data.). Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure.</li>
                            <li>Restriction of Processing to Storage Only: You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data we hold about you other than for storage purposes in the following circumstances: you believe the personal data is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate, we wish to erase the personal data as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to simply restrict the use of that data; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing but you require us to retain the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to us processing personal data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal data whilst we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal data.</li>
                            <li>Objection: You have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we will consider your request. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in relation to legal claims.</li>
                        </ul>
