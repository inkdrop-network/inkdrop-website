                        <p>By clicking “Accept”, or by accessing or using the InkDrop branded application accessible through <a href="https://app.inkdrop.tech" target="_blank">https://app.inkdrop.tech</a> (“Network”), you confirm to have carefully reviewed and to fully understand and agree to the terms and conditions set forth in these terms. You are entering into a legally binding contract with InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) (developers, contractors or founders of InkDrop) (“we”, “our”, “us”) consisting of these Terms of Use and all terms incorporated by reference (collectively, these “Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept these Terms on behalf of an entity, do not click “Accept” and do not access or use the Network.</p>

                        <p>Your access or use of the Network is also subject to our Privacy Policy (<a href="https://www.inkdrop.tech/privacy.html" target="_blank">https://www.inkdrop.tech/privacy.html</a>).</p>

                        <p>Because the current version of InkDrop is a Private-Beta release only, you may be required to review and accept new or supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with InkDrop and newly introduced functionalities in the future.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that the InkDrop Social Network is part of the Web 3 movement. Being fully decentralized, it is powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS). It is therefore not under control of any legal entity or private individual. While the InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) has developed and will continue to develop InkDrop, it does not operate or control it and/or the content made available by its users. The InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) merely operates the web-interface (<a href="https://app.inkdrop.tech" target="_blank">https://app.inkdrop.tech</a>) used to access the InkDrop Network.</p>

                        <!--                        <h5 class="pt-3">1. Code Of Conduct</h5>-->
                        <h5 class="pt-3">1. The Network</h5>
                        <p>The Network is a decentralized social microblogging network that enables its users to spread their message effectively in a certain community or help others to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>Future versions of the Network also intended to reward its users with cryptocurrencies for providing high quality content and moderating the content of the Network.</p>

                        <h5 class="pt-3">2. Who May Use the Network</h5>
                        <p>You may use the Network only if you agree to form a binding contract with InkDrop and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. In any case, you must be at least 18 years old, to use the Network. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Network on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, in which case the words “you” and “your” as used in these Terms shall refer to such entity.</p>
                        <p>You may not create a member account for or use the Network if you are barred from using the Network under these Terms or under any law applicable to you, including the law of the country in which you are resident or from which you would use the Network.</p>
                        <p>You may use the Network without charge. However, we reserve the right to charge fees in the form of eth/gas for using certain features in future versions of the Network.</p>
                        <p>The Ethereum Identity Key contains a pre-set functionality to deduct from your Identity Key Balance a Gas Deduction, which is triggered by every transaction you make on InkDrop. The amount of ETH on your Ethereum Identity Key Balance remains always in your sole control and may be withdrawn any time. InkDrop and/or InkDrop GmbH (i.G.) has no access to your Ethereum Identity Key.</p>

                        <h5 class="pt-3">3. Privacy</h5>
                        <p>In contrast to traditional/mainstream social media services, InkDrop cares deeply about your privacy and is committed to protecting and respecting it. Our Privacy Policy (<a href="https://www.inkdrop.tech/privacy.html" target="_blank">https://www.inkdrop.tech/privacy.html</a>) describes how we handle the information you provide to us when you use the Network.</p>
                        <p>As the Network is intended to have public discussions, certain personal information you provide on your user profile or post on public timelines can be viewed by the general public.</p>
                        <p>Please do not submit any information to you would not want to be publicly available. Please note that search engines may index personal information which you make public.

You understand that user data and other information you submit to the Network may be corrupted or deleted and not subject to recovery.</p>
                        <p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of InkDrop, its users and the public.

It is your responsibility to review the respective terms of use and privacy policies of those third-party links.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You may not fully delete any content published from the InkDrop Platform. When you remove content, your content is only delisted which makes it more difficult to be found for others. However, we will use reasonable efforts to make your content inaccessible.</p>

                        <h5 class="pt-3">5. Using the Network</h5>

                        <h6>Risks</h6>
                        <p>Accessing and using the Network, and transferring ETH to the connected wallet/public key has certain risks. The risks you understand and accept are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Software weaknesses: InkDrop, its smart contracts, the underlying software application and platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) are still in early development and unproven. Thus, InkDrop is unable to warrant that it will run uninterrupted or error-free. The software may contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing complete loss of your profile and/or ETH submitted to the Network.</li>
                            <li>Regulatory: It is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain based applications. These may be contrary to InkDrop’s current setup and may result in substantial modifications of InkDrop, including its termination and the loss of ETH submitted to the Network.</li>
                            <li>Abandonment: For a number of reasons, including a lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, or lack of commercial success or prospects, InkDrop may abandon the development beyond the Beta Version.</li>
                            <li>Theft: InkDrop, its smart contracts, the underlying software application and platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals. This could result in theft or loss of ETH submitted to the Network.</li>
                            <li>Ethereum mining attacks: The blockchain used for InkDrop is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks.</li>
                            <li>New version: Ultimately, the network of miners will be in control of InkDrop. It is possible that a majority of these miners could agree at any point to make changes to the official InkDrop network and run the new version of the smart contract system.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="pt-3">6. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h5>
